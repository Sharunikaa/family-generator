Family Tree Generator

The Family Tree Generator is a Python desktop application that allows users to create and visualize their family tree. By inputting family members' details (name, age, and relationship), users can generate a dynamic family tree displaying hierarchical relationships.

Features
- User-Friendly GUI: Built using Tkinter for an interactive and easy-to-use interface.
- Family Tree Visualization: Utilizes NetworkX for graph representation and Matplotlib for displaying the family tree.
- Interactive Input: Users can add family members and define relationships like parents, siblings, and grandparents.

Techniques Used
- Tkinter: For building the graphical user interface.
- NetworkX:  For creating and managing the family tree structure.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing the generated family tree graph.

How It Works
1. Users input their information (name, age) and select family members to add.
2. The family tree is built dynamically as relationships are entered.
3. The tree is visualized with nodes representing individuals and edges representing familial relationships.
